         <p>In a broad sense, predestination refers to God's knowledge and determination of all
            things before they come to pass. Especially within Augustinian and Calvinist theologies,
            predestination more specifically involves the doctrine of election: without basis in
            anything other than God's will, God has eternally decreed some people to be "saved"
            (i.e., "the elect") and some to be "damned." This additional damnatory aspect, sometimes
            termed "double predestination," does not appear in all accounts of predestination; it
            is, however, a logical consequence of emphasizing God's absolute omnipotence and
            unilateral action within salvation, such that no human can possibly alter their eternal
            outcome. Based on his unshakeable conviction of the universality of God's prevenient
            grace, as well as the genuine free will this affords humanity, John Wesley starkly
            opposed the doctrine of predestination, especially in its Calvinist form.</p>

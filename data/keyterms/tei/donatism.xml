         <p>Donatism was a schismatic movement that divided early North African Christianity
            throughout the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries. The movement, named after
            one of its most prominent leaders, Donatus the Great (c. 310-355), specifically denied
            the validity of sacraments performed by "sinful" (i.e., apostate) clergy. Such a belief
            was simultaneously moral and ecclesiological: the "true" Church—and, by extension, its
            clergy and rites—was necessarily holy and therefore juxtaposed with the sinfulness of
            apostasy. Although Donatism was formally censured at the Council of Arles (314), the
            strongest theological rejection of the movement came from Augustine nearly a century
            later. Rather than root the holiness of the Church and the efficacy of its sacraments in
            the moral purity of its clergy, Augustine contended that sacramental sanctity was
            fundamentally rooted in Christ's righteousness, in which the Church participates by
            faith. Practically speaking, Augustine's teaching—that the sacraments are valid ex opere
            operato ("from the work performed"), not ex opere operantis ("from the work of the
            performer")—repudiated the Donatist argument that sacraments performed by a "sinful"
            celebrant needed to be repeated under "pure" clergy.</p>

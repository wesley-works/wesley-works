         <p>Itinerancy names a primary characteristic in Methodist polity, in which clergypersons
            travel (itinerate) widely throughout an appointed geographical area. The practice began
            with John Wesley appointing the Methodist preachers to various circuits on an annual
            basis at Conference. A preacherâ€™s "charge" would include oversight of a number of
            Methodist societies, each with its own class meetings and band meetings. This traveling
            system provided Methodism a mechanism for maintaining the Methodist "connection,"
            especially as it continued to grow. Itinerancy is still a hallmark of many contemporary
            Methodist denominations, although the duration of appointments has increased drastically
            over the years.</p>

         <p>Pelagianism is the theological position attributed to the British monk Pelagius (ca.
            355-ca. 420) and his followers and vigorously attacked by St. Augustine (354–430).
            Notably, Pelagius denied the incapacitating consequence of original sin on human
            nature—and, with it, what is maintained by a classical doctrine of predestination.
            Instead, he insisted that genuine freedom of the will persists in human nature, even
            after the Fall. Accordingly, Pelagius has often been interpreted as claiming that
            salvation can be earned through human effort alone (i.e., without divine grace), and it
            is to this heresy that the pejorative "Pelagianism" points. Wesley's own theological
            position lies between the extremes of Augustinianism/Calvinism and Pelagianism: while
            Wesley defends the authenticity and consequent responsibility of a free human will, he
            always predicates this upon God's gracious activity.</p>

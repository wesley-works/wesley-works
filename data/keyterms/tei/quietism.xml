         <p>"Quietism" is the collective term given to a set of contemplative Christian practices
            that were seen as overly-minimizing human effort and spiritual responsibility.
            Proponents of quietism (including de Molinos, Madame Guyon, and Archbishop FÃ©nelon) were
            accused of elevating interior, intellectual "stillness" over outward pious action,
            particularly in the form of the mystical "prayer of the quiet." The objective of such
            prayer (and like contemplative practices) was perfection through total passivity and
            dissolution of the human will, thereby disregarding both works of mercy and works of
            piety. John Wesley took exception to this form of spirituality (especially in the
            Moravians) on the basis that it neglected the means of grace.</p>

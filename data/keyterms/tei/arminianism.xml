         <p>Arminianism is a theological position named after Jacob Arminius (1560-1609), a Dutch
            theologian and pastor. Arminius's system may be viewed as a response to Reformed
            (especially Calvinist) theologies of predestination in terms of the relationship of
            grace and election. Rather than base the human reception of grace on God's prior
            election, Arminius conditioned election on the prior reception of grace. Such prevenient
            grace is freely available to all because of the universal scope of Christ's atonement.
            However, since Arminius maintained that grace is resistible, his position rejected both
            universalism and the impossibility of backsliding. John Wesley staunchly self-identified
            as "Arminian," especially regarding the doctrines of prevenient grace, free will,
            universal redemption (atonement), and salvation. Appropriately, these themes featured
            prominently in The Arminian Magazine, a periodical that Wesley began in 1778. </p>

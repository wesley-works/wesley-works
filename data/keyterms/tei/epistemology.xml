         <p>Epistemology (from the Greek epistēmē, "knowledge") is the branch of philosophical
            inquiry that concerns human knowledge, including its nature, origin, scope, and
            veracity. For the likes of Plato, real knowledge could be obtained by the intellect's
            apprehension of the eternal "form" of a thing, with knowledge of particular instances
            being deductions from such forms. For Aristotle, though, humans could only apprehend
            things empirically and sensorily, working inductively through discursive reasoning to
            arrive at genuine knowledge. Within a theological framework, epistemology also touches
            involves the relationship of the (human) intellect to faith: What can be known (and
            truly so) by human reason alone, and how and where does divine revelation enter in? For
            Wesley, humans come to know anything through the senses, with physical senses providing
            the intellect sensory data, and the spiritual senses providing the soul spiritual
            data.</p>

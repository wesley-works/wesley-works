         <p>The Moravians, or Brethren (Unitas Fratrum), are one of the oldest Protestant
            traditions, dating back to the Bohemian Reformation in the 15th century. Historically,
            they have exhibited a strong mixture of fellowship and pietism, especially in the form
            of missionary work to unchurched peoples. In 1722, under the patronage of Count Ludwig
            von Zinzendorf, they settled in Herrnhut (eastern Germany), where they were closely
            linked to the Lutheran Church. John Wesley became affiliated with the Moravians during
            the 1730s—first during a mission to the Georgia colony, then with the newly-formed
            London Fetter Lane Society (established by Peter Böhler earlier that year) in 1738,
            followed by a trip to study with Zinzendorf at Herrnhut. Upon his return to England,
            Wesley drafted the "Rules for the Band Societies" (see Works 9:77-78) into which the
            Fetter Lane Society had been divided. However, by 1740, Wesley had cut ties with the
            Moravians because he believed they had strayed into quietism.</p>

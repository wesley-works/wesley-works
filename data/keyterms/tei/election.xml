         <p>In general, election refers to God's choice of persons or peoples to be involved with
            God's good will and purposes. In the Hebrew Bible, the term could be applied to the
            people of Israel as “God's chosen people”—a theme that is picked up but adapted in the
            New Testament. There, and in subsequent Christian theology, election takes on a
            particular meaning: God's choice of persons to inherit salvation through Jesus Christ.
            In the Western Church, election became informed by an emphasis on God's absolute
            sovereignty, making it a matter of unconditional divine fiat. While not equivalent with
            predestination, this (Western) understanding of election paved the way for
            Reformation-era debates, most notably between Calvinists and Arminians. By contrast, the
            Eastern Church has traditionally not expended such energy on the topic, in large part
            due to its emphasis on the co-operant nature of divine grace.</p>

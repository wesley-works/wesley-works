         <p>Docetism (from the Greek dokein, “to appear, seem”) encapsulates a number of
            Christologies, all of which deny or diminish the full humanity of Jesus Christ. Its
            adherents claim that Jesus only appeared to have suffered and died, for his divinity
            must surely have displaced his inferior humanity (the two being inherently incompatible
            in this system of thought) if he was to be considered fully God. More-extreme forms of
            Docetism melded with a disdain for the physical/material world, as found within early
            Gnosticism. Other forms, such as Apollinarianism, allowed that Jesus’ body was real
            while denying that his mind was genuinely human. The Councils of Nicaea (325) and
            Chalcedon (451) anathematized any Christology that did not uphold the full humanity and
            divinity of Jesus Christ—including Docetism, Gnosticism, Apollinarianism, and
            Arianism.</p>

         <p>Montanism was a charismatic movement that arose in the second century around the
            prophetic figures of Montanus, Priscilla, and Maximilla. Central to the movement were
            extraordinary manifestations of the Holy Spirit (e.g., enthusiasm, prophecy, speaking in
            tongues), which were understood as revelatory of the imminent return of Christ and the
            end of the world. In expectation of this impending apocalypse, and in response to a
            perceived moral decline in the greater Church, Montanism emphasized a rigorous ethic of
            personal asceticism. As with the charges of enthusiasm and regimented discipline, the
            moniker of "Montanism" occasionally adhered to the early Methodist movement.</p>

            Antinomianism (from the Greek anti-, "against," and nomos, "law") is the broad belief that Christians have been released from the obligation to keep the moral law of Judeo-Christian tradition. Such preaching and practice is theologically based on a maximal interpretation of salvation by faith alone through grace aloneâ€”to the absolute exclusion of any human works, here understood as "the law" (see Rom. 7, Gal. 2, etc.). John Wesley fiercely opposed antinomianism as contrary to scripture (see John 14:15; cf. 1 John 2-3) and to holiness, both of which stress a responsibility to love God and neighbor by partaking in the means of grace and, for Methodists, by following the General Rules<ref target="general-rules"/>.

               <p>Converted at the age of thirty-five after hearing <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/> JW</persName> preach at the Foundry, Clark
                  was appointed a class leader. He was so successful that he soon had to form two
                  additional classes. Clark was a close friend and correspondent of <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> and frequently provided
                  hospitality for visiting preachers. When City Road Chapel was erected, Clark took
                  a plot of adjacent land and built a house, which after his death was lived in by
                  one of the City Road ministers. Clark and his wife <persName>Adylena</persName>
                  are interred near the east wall of City Road Chapel close to the altar.
                     <persName>Adylena</persName> (<date from="1727" to="1807">1727–1807</date>) was
                  a favorite of <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> and
                  enjoyed a considerable reputation for piety. See Stevenson, <hi rend="italic">City

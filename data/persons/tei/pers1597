               <p>Perrin was born <date when="1708-05-14">May 14, 1708</date> in
                     <placeName>London</placeName>, the daughter of <persName>Thomas
                     Perrin</persName> (<date from="1678" to="1742">1678–c.1742</date>) and
                     <persName>Sarah (Groom) Perrin</persName> (<date from="1683" to="1735">1683–c.
                     1735</date>). Her parents, both of Quaker merchant families, were married in
                     <date when="1699">1699</date> in <placeName>London</placeName> and had five
                  children that reached adulthood—<persName>Mary</persName> (b. <date when="1704"
                     >1704</date>), <persName>Samuel</persName> (b. <date when="1706">1706</date>),
                     <persName>James</persName> (b. <date when="1709">1709</date>), and
                     <persName>Thomas</persName> (b. <date when="1711">1711</date>), in addition to
                  Sarah. Sarah&apos;s father became involved in importing tobacco from
                     <placeName>North America</placeName> and resorted to devious means to avoid the
                  increasing excise tax. His actions uncovered, Thomas was put in
                     <placeName>Fleet</placeName> prison in <date when="1712">1712</date>, with his
                  merchandise seized and a hefty debt of unpaid taxes. Bribing his way out of prison
                  in <date when="1716">1716</date>, Thomas went briefly to
                     <placeName>Holland</placeName>, and then on to
                     <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, where he resided until his death.
                  Fortunately for <persName>Sarah (Groom) Perrin</persName>, several lines of
                  inheritance from her family were protected from the seizure of
                     <persName>Thomas</persName>&apos;s property, and she was able to provide for
                  her children, living with extended family in the <placeName>London</placeName>
                  area. After their mother&apos;s death, <persName>Mary</persName> and Sarah Perrin
                  likely went to live in <placeName>Bradford-on-Avon</placeName>—with their aunt
                     <persName>Constant (Groom) Bailward</persName> (<date from="1686" to="1746"
                     >1686–1746</date>) and her husband <persName>John</persName> (d. <date
                     when="1744">1744</date>). But by <date when="1739-01">January 1739</date> the
                  sisters had also acquired property in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. Sarah met
                  both <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> and
                        <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>CW</persName> the following
                  year and was soon corresponding with them. Their interchange led Sarah to join the
                  Church of <placeName>England</placeName> within a couple of years. At
                        <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s
                  invitation, Sarah became the housekeeper at the New Room in
                     <placeName>Bristol</placeName> in <date when="1744-02">Feb. 1744.</date> She
                  was one of three women that <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                     />JW</persName> suggested as a possible wife for <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>CW</persName> in <date when="1748"
                     >1748</date>. Instead, Perrin became the second wife of <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers1179.xml"/>John Jones</persName> (<date from="1721"
                     to="1785">1721–85</date>) on <date when="1752-05-20">May 20, 1752</date>. She
                  accompanied <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1179.xml"/>Jones</persName> in
                     <date when="1758">1758</date> to work among the Methodists in
                     <placeName>London</placeName>; and then into the parish of
                     <placeName>Harwich</placeName> when <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers1179.xml"/>Jones</persName> was ordained. See Letter of

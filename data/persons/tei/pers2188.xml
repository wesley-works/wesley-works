               <p>Samuel Wesley was baptized on <date when="1662-12-17">Dec. 17, 1662</date> in
                     <placeName>Winterbourne Whitechurch, Dorsetshire</placeName>, by his father,
                  Rev. <persName>John Westley</persName>. This was also the year of the Restoration
                  of the Act of Uniformity in the Church of <placeName>England</placeName>, and
                  Samuel's father (a staunch Puritan) was soon forced out of his parish and the
                  Church. Rev. <persName>Westley</persName> continued to preach undercover, as a
                  Dissenter, and endured the resulting imprisonments, which contributed to his death
                  in <date when="1671">1671</date>. After losing his father, Samuel was educated in
                  dissenting academies (through support of family friends) in preparation for the
                  possibility of ministry himself. But Samuel proved of independent mind, deciding
                  to align with the Church of <placeName>England</placeName>, and entering Exeter
                  College in <placeName>Oxford</placeName> in <date when="1684">1684</date> (at
                  which time he dropped the 't' from the spelling of his name). In <date when="1688">1688</date> Samuel received his <seg ana="degree">BA</seg> in <date when="1688-05">May</date>, was ordained deacon in <date when="1688-08">Aug</date>., and married <persName>
                            <ref target="/persons/pers2193.xml"/>Susanna Annesley</persName> on <date when="1688-11-12">Nov. 12</date>. He was
                  ordained priest the following year. Samuel initially tried to support the family
                  through literary ventures with his brother-in-law <persName>John
                  Dunton</persName>, and a stint as a chaplain in the Navy. In <date when="1691-06">June 1691</date> he opted to become rector of a small parish in
                     <placeName>South Ormsby, Lincolnshire</placeName>, to which another small
                  charge was added the following year in nearby <placeName>South
                     Thoresby</placeName>. In <date when="1695-04">April 1695</date> he moved to
                  become rector of <placeName>Epworth</placeName>, where he would remain until his
                  death (adding <placeName>Wroot</placeName> to his care in <date when="1722">1722</date>). By all accounts, Samuel was a faithful pastor, though his strict
                  discipline and strong political views made him unpopular with many of his
                  parishioners. Likewise, while Samuel achieved a measure of recognition through his
                  writings and involvement in Church convocations, his place in history is secured
                  through his children—particularly <persName>

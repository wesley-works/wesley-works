               <p>Meriton was educated at Gonville and Caius College,
                     <placeName>Cambridge</placeName>, and ordained deacon in <date when="1723"
                     >1723</date> to serve as curate to his stepfather, the rector of
                     <placeName>Oxborough, Norfolk</placeName>. In <date when="1740">1740</date> he
                  served as a hired clergyman in the <placeName>Isle of Man</placeName>, arousing
                  some opposition because of his evangelical preaching. He was befriended by
                        <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> and by
                        <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2221.xml"/>Whitefield</persName>, who
                  sought to have him appointed minister of <placeName>Savannah</placeName>. By <date
                     when="1744">1744</date> Meriton was closely associated with the Wesley
                  brothers, and attended their first Conference that year. For a few years he
                  accompanied one or other of them on their preaching <seg ana="itinerancy"
                     >itineraries</seg>. He was sincere, able, and courageous, but somewhat
                  unpredictable, so that their relationship cooled off, and eventually they parted.

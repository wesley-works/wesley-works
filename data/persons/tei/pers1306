            <person xml:id="pers1306">
               <p>Samuel Lloyd was born into a family of &apos;silk throwers&apos; in the
                     <placeName>London</placeName> area who worked for <persName>Thomas
                     Lombe</persName> (<date from="1685" to="1739">1685–1739</date>).
                     <persName>Lombe</persName>&apos;s brother <persName>John</persName> had
                  surreptitiously copied a mechanized process developed in
                     <placeName>Italy</placeName> for preparing raw silk for weaving.
                     <persName>Thomas</persName> replicated the process in
                     <placeName>Derby</placeName> in <date when="1717">1717</date> and then in
                     <placeName>Spitalfields, London</placeName>. While he entered the family trade,
                  at <persName>Lombe</persName>&apos;s advice, in <date when="1723">1723</date>,
                  Lloyd soon tired of it and in <date when="1726">1726</date> began setting himself
                  up as a silk merchant instead. At this point <persName>Lombe</persName> approached
                  Lloyd about the possibility of going to <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> and
                  setting up silk farms. As preparation, <persName>Lombe</persName> suggested that
                  Lloyd go to <placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>Italy</placeName> to
                  observe how the trade operated there, serving as a buyer of silk for
                     <persName>Lombe</persName> while he was there. The venture in
                     <placeName>Carolina</placeName> was repeatedly delayed and Lloyd ended up
                  serving as one of <persName>Lombe</persName>&apos;s silk buyers in
                     <placeName>Italy</placeName> from <date from="1727" to="1734">1727–34</date>.
                  At that point Lloyd formed a partnership with <persName>Thomas Unwin</persName>,
                  an English merchant in <placeName>Livorno, Italy</placeName>, and became a silk
                  merchant. Lloyd left this partnership and returned to
                     <placeName>England</placeName> about <date when="1739">1739</date>, setting up
                  his own business as a silk merchant in <placeName>London</placeName>, with his
                  main office and residence on <placeName>Devonshire Square</placeName>. Lloyd
                  quickly became active among the Huguenot community in
                     <placeName>Spitalfields</placeName>. These French immigrants had become a
                  center of silk weaving in <placeName>London</placeName>. Lloyd participated in the
                  founding of a Huguenot church on <placeName>Brick Lane</placeName> in <date
                     when="1743">1743</date>, and is listed as a deacon of the church on
                     <placeName>Threadneedle Street</placeName> in <date when="1744">1744</date>. He
                  also was elected a trustee for the colony of <placeName>Georgia</placeName> in
                     <date when="1747">1747</date>, at a time when it was hoped that
                     <placeName>Georgia</placeName> might host major plantations cultivating the
                  silk worm. Lloyd was drawn into the Methodist revival in late <date when="1748"
                     >1748</date>. He became particularly close to <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>CW</persName>, but assisted both Wesley
                  brothers in business matters over the next two decades. In <date when="1766-08"
                     >August 1766</date> Lloyd listed his <placeName>Devonshire Square</placeName>
                  property for sale and retired from the silk trade. He lived briefly at
                     <placeName>Paternoster Row in Spitalfields</placeName>, then settled at
                     <placeName>Friday Hill</placeName> near <placeName>Woodford in
                     Essex</placeName>. He died on <date when="1775-07-12">July 12, 1775</date>. See
                     <hi rend="italic">London Chronicle</hi> (<date from="1775-07-13"
                     to="1775-07-15">July 13–15, 1775</date>), p. 54; a legal document detailing his

                  Whitchurch Free [Grammar] School, <placeName>Shropshire</placeName>, and proved
                  such a student that when the current master died, Bayley was named his replacement
                  at the age of 17. Since his father was active in Methodist circles Bayley soon
                  came to <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s
                  attention, and by <date when="1773">1773</date> he had moved to Kingswood in the

                  active at Kingswood). He was ordained an elder the following year and served as

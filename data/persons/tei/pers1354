            <person xml:id="pers1354">
               <p><persName>Nicholas Manners</persName> was born in <placeName>Sledmere,
                     Yorkshire</placeName>, and drawn into the Methodist revival in his later teens.
                  By fall <date when="1758">1758</date> he was exploring joining his older brother
                        <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers1353.xml"/>John</persName> in <seg
                     ana="itinerancy">itinerant</seg> ministry, and by <date when="1762">1762</date>
                  was in regular appointment (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, 10:294). By <date
                     when="1768">1768</date> he had risen to the stature of an &quot;assistant&quot;
                  (10:353). He was assigned to <placeName>York</placeName> in <date when="1769"
                     >1769</date>, but notes in his memoirs that he only travelled a few weeks and
                  then took a five year leave from riding a circuit. <persName>Manners</persName>
                  was next found under appointment in <date when="1774">1774</date>, but the next
                  year he published a collection of <hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi>, apparently
                  without prior approval from <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                     />JW</persName> as required in the <hi rend="italic">Minutes</hi>. Being called
                  to question at the <date when="1775">1775</date> Conference,
                     <persName>Manners</persName> desisted from travelling that year (10:440). He
                  returned to travelling in <date when="1776">1776</date>, apparently in conjunction
                  with issuing a revised version of his <hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi> about the
                  same time (which <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>
                  stocked in the book room in <placeName>London</placeName>).
                     <persName>Nicholas</persName> received appointment the next several years, but
                  he also quietly continued to publish small tracts, helping spur the restatement of
                  the prohibition against printing at the <date when="1781">1781</date> Conference
                  (see Q. 25, 10:516). Matters came to a head at the <date when="1784">1784</date>
                  Conference, when <persName>Manners&apos;s</persName> most recent work was judged
                  by many to deny the doctrine of original sin (see Q. 20, 10:562). At this juncture
                     <persName>Manners</persName> severed his relationship with the Methodists and
                  began to publish works critical of them.</p>

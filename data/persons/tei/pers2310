               <p>A German count, born in <placeName>Dresden</placeName>,
                     <persName>Zinzendorf</persName> studied at the Pietist school in
                     <placeName>Halle</placeName> and the Lutheran university of
                     <placeName>Wittenberg</placeName>. While deeply religious, his family dissuaded
                  him from ordination, so <persName>Zinzendorf</persName> became a councillor to the
                  Elector of Saxony, and married <persName>Erdmuth Dorothea Reuss</persName>. In
                     <date when="1722">1722</date> he welcomed exiles from
                     <placeName>Moravia</placeName> to establish the community of Herrnhut on his
                     <placeName>Berthelsdorf</placeName> estate. While still committed to the
                  Lutheran Church, <persName>Zinzendorf</persName> effectively became pastor to the
                  community by <date when="1727">1727</date> (resigning his work as a councillor).
                  He lead them in organizing as the &apos;<seg ana="moravians">Renewed Church of the
                     United Brethren</seg>&apos;, or more popularly, the <seg ana="moravians"
                     >Moravians</seg>. By <date when="1737">1737</date> Zinzendorf had been
                  consecrated as the bishop of the <seg ana="moravians">Moravians</seg>, and it was
                  in this role that he would carry on correspondence with the Wesley brothers. See

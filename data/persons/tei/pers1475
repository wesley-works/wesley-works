               <p><persName>Moss</persName>, born in <placeName>Hurlston, Chesire</placeName>, was
                  raised by his grandparents and apprenticed as a tailor. He came to
                     <placeName>London</placeName> in <date when="1737">1737</date>, where he heard
                        <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2221.xml"/>Whitefield</persName> preach
                  the following summer. By his admission, he was prone to drinking and sexual
                  promiscuity during this time, which eventuated in him marrying under pressure (due
                  to a pregnancy) a <persName>Mary Robinson</persName> in <placeName>Middlewich,
                     Cheshire</placeName> on <date when="1741-12-26">Dec. 26, 1741</date>. This
                  relationship proved unfit and he soon left her (while <persName>Mary</persName>
                  quickly took another husband; and on his death, a third one in
                     <placeName>Dublin</placeName>). <persName>Moss</persName> returned to
                     <placeName>London</placeName>, where he eventually heard <persName><ptr
                        target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> preach and by <date
                     when="1744">1744</date> was not only a Methodist but living at the
                     <placeName>Foundery</placeName> and accompanying <persName><ptr
                        target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> on preaching trips. While
                  mainly a servant, <persName>Moss</persName> preached occasionally on these trips,
                  and in <date when="1747">1747</date> was listed as one of <persName><ptr
                        target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s Assistants. In <date
                     when="1748">1748</date>
                  <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> made
                     <persName>Moss</persName> master at Kingswood School. In <date when="1752"
                     >1752</date> (with the Wesley brothers&apos; encouragement, but apparently
                  without full disclosure of his previous marriage) <persName>Moss</persName>
                  married <persName>Hannah Johnson</persName>. When <persName>Hannah</persName> died
                  in <date when="1765">1765</date>, <persName>Moss</persName> remarried shortly
                  after to the Methodist widow <persName>Sarah Bachelor</persName> of
                     <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. In <date when="1767-02">Feb. 1767</date>,
                  through the efforts of <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers0964.xml"/>Lady
                     Huntingdon</persName>, <persName>Moss</persName> was ordained both deacon and
                  priest in the Church of <placeName>England</placeName>; and later <date
                     when="1767">that year</date> accepted assignment by the SPG as a missionary
                  priest to <placeName>Harbour Island, Bahamas</placeName>, leaving his wife and
                  family in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. A year or so later
                     <persName>Sarah</persName> became aware of <persName>Moss</persName>&apos;s
                  first marriage and disavowed their union. <persName><ptr
                        target="/persons/pers2177.xml"/>CW</persName> in particular felt betrayed
                  (see his pained <date when="1769">1769</date> letter to
                  <persName>Moss</persName>); but <persName>Moss</persName> continued to send
                  friendly correspondence to <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                     />JW</persName> (like <date when="1777-04-28">Apr. 28, 1777</date>).
                     <persName>Moss</persName>&apos;s apparent status as a bigamist (since
                     <persName>Mary</persName> was still alive, and there was no annulment) was
                  eventually brought to the attention of the SPG, who dropped their support in <date
                     when="1779-01">Jan. 1779</date>, though he continued to pastor the congregation
                  in <placeName>Harbour Island</placeName> until his death. See <hi rend="italic"

         <p>A graduate of <placeName type="education">Clare College, Cambridge</placeName>, Dodd
            first sought a literary career. When it became clear he could not support himself solely
            in this way, he was ordained in <date when="1752-01-01">1752</date>. He became a popular
            preacher in <placeName>London</placeName>, especially from the pulpit of
               <placeName>Magdalen House</placeName>, and in <date when="1763-01-01">1763</date> was
            appointed chaplain to the king. He received his <seg ana="degree">DD</seg> in 1766. He
            was known as the 'macaroni parson' because of his worldly style of living,
            became deeply involved in debt, was arrested for forging a bond, was convicted and
            sentenced to death. The execution was carried out on <date when="1777-06-27">June 27,
               1777</date>. He attacked JW's Arminian views in the <hi rend="italic">Christian
               Magazine</hi> (<date when="1760-01-01">1760</date>–<date when="1767-01-01">67</date>), drawing JW's defense. At Dodd's request, JW visited him in prison
            prior to his execution. See <hi rend="italic">Alumni Catabrigienses</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>.</p>

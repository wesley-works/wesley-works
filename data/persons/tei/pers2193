               <p>Susanna was born to Rev. <persName>Samuel</persName> and <persName>Mary (White)
                     Annesley</persName> on <date when="1669-01-20">Jan. 20, 1669</date> in
                     <placeName>London</placeName>. Among other gifts she received from her parents,
                  Susanna was taught to read and encouraged to draw from the full range of her
                  father&apos;s library. She became versed in theology and developed an independence
                  of thought that eventually led her to leave her father&apos;s dissenting
                  (Presbyterian) church and join the Church of England. In her late teens Susanna
                  met <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2188.xml"/>Samuel Wesley</persName>, who
                  had taken a similar journey, and they were married on <date when="1688-11-12">Nov.
                     12, 1688</date>. Susanna accompanied <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2188.xml"/>Samuel</persName> through his various
                  parishes, and gave birth to at least seventeen children. She took an active hand
                  in her children&apos;s early education, insuring that her daughters in particular
                  were encouraged to the life of the mind. Among her surviving correspondence are
                  several letters instructing the boys in spiritual matters while they are away at
                  boarding schools, and catechetical material prepared for her daughters when the
                  family was scattered due to a fire at the rectory in
                     <placeName>Epworth</placeName>. After the death of her husband, Susanna lived
                  with various of her children, settling finally in <placeName>London</placeName> at
                  the Foundery. She died on <date when="1742-07-30">July 30, 1742</date> and is
                  buried in <placeName>Bunhill Fields</placeName>. See Clarke, <hi rend="italic"

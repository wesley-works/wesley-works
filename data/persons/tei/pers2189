               <p><persName>Samuel Wesley</persName> was baptized on <date when="1662-12-17">Dec.
                     17, 1662</date> in <placeName>Winterbourne Whitechurch,
                  Dorsetshire</placeName>, by his father, <persName>Rev. John Westley</persName>.
                  This was also the year of the Restoration of the Act of Uniformity in the Church
                  of <placeName>England</placeName>, and <persName>Samuel</persName>&apos;s father
                  (a staunch Puritan) was soon forced out of his parish and the Church.
                     <persName>Rev. Westley</persName> continued to preach undercover, as a
                  Dissenter, and endured the resulting imprisonments, which contributed to his death
                  in <date when="1671">1671</date>. After losing his father,
                     <persName>Samuel</persName> was educated in dissenting academies (through
                  support of family friends) in preparation for the possibility of ministry himself.
                  But <persName>Samuel</persName> proved of independent mind, deciding to align with
                  the Church of <placeName>England</placeName>, and entering Exeter College in
                     <placeName>Oxford</placeName> in <date when="1684">1684</date> (at which time
                  he dropped the &apos;t&apos; from the spelling of his name). In <date when="1688"
                     >1688</date>
                  <persName>Samuel</persName> received his <seg ana="degree">BA</seg> in <date
                     when="1688-05">May</date>, was ordained deacon in <date when="1688-08"
                     >Aug</date>., and married <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2193.xml"
                     />Susanna Annesley</persName> on <date when="1688-11-12">Nov. 12</date>. He was
                  ordained priest the following year. <persName>Samuel</persName> initially tried to
                  support the family through literary ventures with his brother-in-law
                     <persName>John Dunton</persName>, and a stint as a chaplain in the Navy. In
                     <date when="1691-06">June 1691</date> he opted to become rector of a small
                  parish in <placeName>South Ormsby, Lincolnshire</placeName>, to which another
                  small charge was added the following year in nearby <placeName>South
                     Thoresby</placeName>. In <date when="1695-04">April 1695</date> he moved to
                  become rector of <placeName>Epworth</placeName>, where he would remain until his
                  death (adding <placeName>Wroot</placeName> to his care in <date when="1722"
                     >1722</date>). By all accounts, <persName>Samuel</persName> was a faithful
                  pastor, though his strict discipline and strong political views made him unpopular
                  with many of his parishioners. Likewise, while <persName>Samuel</persName>
                  achieved a measure of recognition through his writings and involvement in Church
                  convocations, his place in history is secured through his children—particularly
                        <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> and
                        <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>CW</persName>. See <hi

               <p>Little biographical evidence is available upon Mrs. Lefevre. <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>CW</persName> wrote a two part poem for her
                  death on <date when="1756-07-06">July 6, 1756</date>, which implied that she was
                  thirty-three years old. Scattered clues indicate that she had been converted and
                  had become a Methodist only two or three years earlier. Of her character and
                  spirituality, however, there is ample evidence. <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers0719.xml"/>John Fletcher</persName> testified,
                  &apos;She lived a saint and died an angel&apos;. In his poems <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>CW</persName> described her as &apos;a
                  spotless soul, a sinless saint, in perfect love renewed&apos;, and <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> spoke of her as &apos;a
                  dove-like woman, full of faith and humble love, and harmless as a little
                  child&apos;. After her death, ninety of her devout letters were published by her
                  husband, and although all names were suppressed it seems clear that five of these
                  were to <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>. Twelve years
                  later <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> reprinted
                  fifty-five of the ninety, together with one further letter to him.</p>

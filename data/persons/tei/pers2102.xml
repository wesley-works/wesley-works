                        <persName>Viney</persName> was a <placeName>London</placeName> tailor with
                  business contacts in <placeName>Germany</placeName> and proficiency in German. He
                  was an early member of the Fetter Lane society, and interpreted for <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers0197.xml"/>Peter Bohler</persName> in
                     <placeName>London</placeName>. <persName>Viney</persName> joined <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> in visiting the <seg ana="moravians">Moravians</seg> in <placeName>Germany</placeName> in <date when="1738">1738</date>. He stayed after <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> returned, and aligned himself
                  with the <seg ana="moravians">Moravians</seg>. <persName>Viney</persName> returned
                  to <placeName>England</placeName> in <date when="1739">1739</date> and gave
                  leadership to the <seg ana="moravian">Moravian</seg> continuation of the Fetter
                  Lane society. In <date when="1742">1742</date> he became master of the <seg ana="moravian">Moravian</seg> school in <placeName>London</placeName>, which
                  soon moved to <placeName>Broad Oaks, Essex</placeName>. In early <date when="1743">1743</date> he went to <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName> to give guidance to
                        <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers1121.xml"/>Benjamin
                  Ingham</persName>'s former societies, but came afoul of Spanenberg later that
                  year and was excommunicated. For about a year <persName>Viney</persName> swung his
                  loyalties to the Methodists, plying his trade as a tailor and staymaker, while
                  working for <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> in
                  various capacities, including that of bookbinder (his diary for <date when="1744">1744</date> is a mine of information on early Methodism). But his <seg ana="moravians">Moravian</seg> tendencies remained, leading <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> not to trust him, and by <date when="1745">1745</date> he had moved to <placeName>Halifax</placeName> and
                  apparently rejoined the <seg ana="moravians">Moravians</seg> (though details of
                  his life after <date when="1744">1744</date> are very sketchy). See <hi rend="italic">DEB</hi>, 1145; and Vickers, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi>,
                  364–65.</p>

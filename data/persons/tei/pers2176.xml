               <p>Born <date when="1707-12-18">Dec. 18, 1707</date> in
                     <placeName>Epworth</placeName>, the next to last child of <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2188.xml"/>Samuel Wesley</persName> and <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2193.xml"/>Susanna (Annesley) Wesley</persName>,
                     <persName>CW</persName> was sent at the age of 8 to live in
                     <placeName>Westminster</placeName> with his oldest brother <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2189.xml"/>Samuel Jr</persName>. who had recently
                  become an usher in Westminster School. In <date when="1721">1721</date>
                  <persName>CW</persName> was admitted as a King's Scholar at
                     <placeName>Westminster</placeName>. In <date when="1726-06">June 1726</date> he
                  was elected to Christ Church, <placeName>Oxford</placeName>, though it was a year
                  before he secured the additional necessary funding to matriculate. In his first
                  year at <placeName>Oxford</placeName>, away from all family influence
                        (<persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> was assisting
                  his father in <placeName>Wroot</placeName>), <persName>CW</persName> explored the
                  'world' a bit, but by <date when="1729-03">Mar 1729</date> was gathering
                  with a couple of friends to support one another in piety and Christian charity—the
                  beginnings of the 'Oxford Methodists'. <persName>CW</persName> also
                  became part of the Cotswalds circle during this time, where his literary nickname
                  was '<persName>Araspes</persName>'. <persName>CW</persName> received his
                     <seg ana="degree">BA</seg> in <date when="1730">1730</date> and <seg ana="degree">MA</seg> in <date when="1733">1733</date>. In <date when="1735">1735</date>, after the death of his father and in preparation for joining
                        <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> on the trip to
                     <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, <persName>CW</persName> was ordained both
                  deacon (<date when="1735-09-21">Sept. 21</date>) and priest (<date when="1735-09-29">Sept. 29</date>) in the Church of
                     <placeName>England</placeName>. <persName>CW</persName> went to
                     <placeName>Georgia</placeName> as <persName>Oglethorpe</persName>'s
                  secretary; he lasted less than a year, before returning to
                     <placeName>England</placeName> (landing <date when="1736-12-03">Dec. 3,
                     1736</date>). <persName>CW</persName>'s 'evangelical conversion'
                  in <date when="1738">1738</date> took place on <placeName>Pentecost</placeName>
                     (<date when="1738-05-21">May 21</date>), preceding his brother <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> by three days. The brothers
                  were soon engaged in the revival, with <persName>CW</persName> initially <seg ana="itinerancy">traveling and preaching</seg> nearly as much as <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>. In <date when="1747-08">Aug
                     1747</date>, while preaching in <placeName>Wales</placeName>,
                     <persName>CW</persName> met <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2191.xml"/>Sarah Gwynne Jr.</persName> The attraction between the two grew quickly, and
                  they were married on <date when="1749-04-08">April 8, 1749</date>. One result was
                  that <persName>CW</persName> soon ended regular <seg ana="itinerancy">itinerancy</seg>, focusing his pastoral support of Methodism in
                     <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and <placeName>London</placeName>, and producing
                  a major body of hymns and other religious verse. <persName>Charles</persName> and
                        <persName>
                            <ptr target="/persons/pers2191.xml"/>Sarah</persName> also
                  produced eight children, though only three lived past infancy. Through his later
                  years <persName>CW</persName> frequently criticized the desire of many Methodists
                  to separate from the Church of <placeName>England</placeName>—and chided his
                  brother for treating this threat too mildly. He died on <date when="1788-03-29">
                     March 29, 1788</date>, very much a member of the Church, and was buried on
                  consecrated ground at St. Marylebone church. See <hi rend="italic">Alumni

               <p>Mary was apparently the daughter of <persName>John</persName> and <persName>Martha
                     (Harvest) Bishop</persName> who was baptized <date when="1741-02-20">Feb. 20,
                     1741</date>, in <placeName>Bath, Somerset</placeName>. By the
                     mid-<date>1760s</date> she was running a boarding school in The Vineyards
                  neighborhood of <placeName>Bath</placeName>. She became associated with
                        <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0964.xml"/>Lady Huntingdon</persName>,
                  when the <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0964.xml"/>Countess</persName> opened
                  her paragon chapel in The Vineyards. Some tension with Lady <persName><ref
                        target="/persons/pers0964.xml"/>Huntingdon</persName> led Bishop to approach
                  the Methodist society meeting on <placeName>Avon Street</placeName> in late <date
                     when="1769">1769</date>, and she soon was taking leadership in the group. Mary
                  became quite ill in <date when="1777">1777</date>, closed her school, went for a
                  while to <placeName>Frome</placeName>. By <date when="1782">1782</date> she had
                  moved to <placeName>Keynsham</placeName> and was opening a new boarding school.
                  Mary and <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> carried on
                  frequent correspondence from <date when="1769">1769</date> through <date
                     when="1784">1784</date>. In <date when="1789-08">August 1789</date> Mary Bishop
                  was wed to <persName>Thomas Mills</persName> (<date from="1735" to="1820"
                     >1735–1820</date>), a widowed Quaker bookseller in
                     <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. Mary aligned with the Quakers and the couple
                  were buried together in the Redcliff Pit Quaker burying ground in

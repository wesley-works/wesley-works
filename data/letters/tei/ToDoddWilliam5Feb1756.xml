                <salute>Rev. Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p> I am favoured with yours of <date when="1756-01-26">January 26</date>
                <note place="foot" n="2">This letter does not appear to have survived.</note>, for
                which I return to you my sincere thanks. Your frank and open manner of writing is
                far from needing any apology, and I hope I will never occasion your receiving such
                treatment from me as I did from Mr. <persName>[William] Law</persName>, who, after
                some very keen expressions in answer to the second private letter I sent him,
                plainly told me he desired to 'hear no more on that head' <note place="foot" n="3"> This phrase does not occur in <persName>Law</persName>
                    's letter of <date when="1738-05-19">May 19</date> or that of <date when="1738-05-22">[May 22?], 1738</date>, but seems to be
                        <persName>Wesley</persName> 's summary of the correspondence, as
                    expressed in the closing sentence of the second letter: 'Pray sir, be at
                    peace with me.' See 25:543–46, 548–50 in this edn. </note> . I do desire to
                hear, and am very willing to consider, whatever you have to advance on the head of
                    <seg ana="ChristianPerfection">'Christian perfection'</seg> . </p>
            <p> When I began to make the Scriptures my chief study (about the seven and twenty years
                ago) <note place="foot" n="4">
                    <persName>Wesley</persName> consistently dated the origins of the <seg ana="Methodism">Methodist</seg> movement to the year <date when="1729-01-01">1729</date> . In response to the question 'What was the rise of <seg ana="Methodism">Methodism</seg>, so called?' in the <bibl>Large
                        Minutes</bibl>, <persName>Wesley</persName> wrote, 'In <date when="1729-01-01">1729</date>, two young men, reading the Bible, saw they
                    could not be saved without <seg ana="holiness">holiness</seg>, followed after
                    it and incited others so to do' (10:875 in this edn.). </note> I began to
                see that Christians are called to <index indexName="biblical">
                    <term cRef="Cf. Deut. 6:5 Luke 10:27">'love god with all'</term>
                </index> their <index indexName="biblical">
                    <term cRef="Cf. Deut. 6:5 Luke 10:27">'heart'</term>
                </index>, and to <index indexName="biblical">
                    <term cRef="Cf. Deut. 6:5 Luke 10:27">'serve him with all'</term>
                </index> their <index indexName="biblical">
                    <term cRef="Cf. Deut. 6:5 Luke 10:27">'strength'</term>
                </index>, which is precisely what I apprehend to be meant by the scriptual term
                    <index indexName="biblical">
                    <term cRef="Cf. Deut. 6:5 Luke 10:27">' <seg ana="ChristianPerfection">perfection</seg> ' </term>
                </index> . After weighing this for some years, I openly declared my sentiments
                before the university, in the sermon on <bibl>'The Circumcision of the
                    Heart'</bibl>, now printed in the second volume. <note place="foot" n="5">
                    I.e., of <persName>JW</persName> 's <bibl>

                from <persName>Bishop Gibson</persName>, <note place="foot" n="6">

                </note> 'Tell all the world what you mean by <seg ana="ChristianPerfection">perfection</seg> ', I published my coolest and latest thoughts in the
                sermon on that subject. <note place="foot" n="7">
                    <persName>JW</persName>, <bibl>

                    </bibl>, published in <date when="1741-01-01">1741</date> (2:97–124 in this
                    edn.). </note> You easily observe, I therein build on no authority, ancient or
                modern, but the Scripture. If this supports any doctrine, it will stand; if not, the
                sooner it falls the better. Neither the doctrine in question, nor any other, is
                anything to me, unless it be the doctrine of Christ and his <seg ana="apostles">apostles</seg> . If, therefore, you will please to point out to me any passages
                in that sermon which are either contrary to Scripture, or not supported by it, and
                to show that they are not, I shall be full as willing to oppose as ever I was to
                defend them. I search for <seg ana="truth">truth: plain, Bible truth</seg>, without
                any regard to the praise or dispraise of men. </p>
            <closer> If you will assist me in this search, more especially by showing me where I
                have mistaken my way, it will be gratefully acknowledged by, rev. sir, <lb/>

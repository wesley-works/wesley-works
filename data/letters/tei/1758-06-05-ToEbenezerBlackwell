            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I suppose my <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>wife</persName> is now in
               <placeName>London</placeName>, as the letters I received thence in the last
               frank<note place="foot" n="2">The word &apos;frank&apos; denoted a parcel of letters
               marked for free delivery.</note> were open; for <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>she</persName> still insists on <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>her</persName> right of reading all the letters
            which are sent to me. And I have no friend or servant where <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>she</persName> is who has honesty and courage to
            prevent it. I find since I left England all my domestics have changed their sentiments,
            and are convinced <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>she</persName> is a
            poor, quiet creature that is barbarously used. I should not at all wonder if my
               <persName>brother</persName><!-- Which brother does this refer to? --> and you were
            brought over to the same opinion.</p>
         <p>Since I came into this kingdom I have wrote several times. But I have not received one
            line in answer. So I sit still.<note place="foot" n="3">The version of the letter given
               in Tyerman begins at this point, omitting all the previous material. It also omits
               the following sentences: &apos;I have in this respect done what <hi rend="italic">I
                  ought</hi> and what <hi rend="italic">I could</hi>. Now let God do what seemeth
               him good.&apos;</note> I have learned by the grace of God in every state to be
            content. I have in this respect done what <hi rend="italic">I ought</hi> and what <hi
               rend="italic">I could</hi>. Now let God do what seemeth him good. What a peace do we
            find in all circumstances when we can say, &apos;Not as I will, but as thou
               wilt!&apos;<note place="foot" n="4">The fragmentary copy at Emory University ends at
               this point. In addition, everything in this paragraph after &apos;So I sit
               still&apos; is struck through, as if for omission. This material is not shown as
               struck through in the copy at MARC, but it too lacks the remaining material in the
               letter up to &apos;My best wishes attend you&apos;.</note></p>
         <p>I have now gone through the greatest part of this kingdom—
               <placeName>Leinster</placeName>, <placeName>Ulster</placeName>, and the greater half
            of <placeName>Connaught</placeName>. Time only is wanting. If my
               <persName>brother</persName>
            <!-- Which brother, who to tag here? -->could take care of
               <placeName>England</placeName> and give me but one year for
               <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, I think every corner of this nation would receive the
            truth as it is in Jesus. They want only to hear it; and they will hear me, high and low,
            rich and poor. What a mystery of providence is this! In <placeName>England</placeName>
            they may hear, but will not. In <placeName>Ireland</placeName> they fain would hear, but
            cannot. So in both, thousands perish for lack of knowledge. So much the more blessed are
            your ears, for they hear; if you not only hear the word of God, but keep it.</p>
         <p>I hope you find public affairs changing for the better. In this corner of the world we
            know little about them; only we are told that the great little king in Moravia is not
            swallowed up yet.<note place="foot" n="5">During the Seven Years War, Prussian King
               Frederick the Great invaded Moravia, then part of the Hapsburg monarchy, in <date
                  when="1758-05">May 1758</date>. At the end of <date when="1758-06">June</date>,
               the Austrian army aligned with the Hapsburg empire won an unexpected victory over the
               Prussian army in the battle of
               Domstadtl.<!-- I am note sure how to tag any of these details with accuracy, i.e. Austrian army,Hapsburg empire etc. --></note></p>
         <p>Till near the middle of next month I expect to be at Mr. <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers0128.xml"/>Beauchamp</persName>&apos;s in
               <placeName>Limerick</placeName>. I hope you have a fruitful season in every respect.
            My best wishes attend you all.<note place="foot" n="6">The copy at MARC lacks the word
               &apos;all&apos; and summarises the concluding &apos;your affectionate servant&apos;
               to &apos;yr affect.&apos;</note> I am, dear sir,</p>

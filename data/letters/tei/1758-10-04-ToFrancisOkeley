            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>The plain reason why I did not answer you before is I had no heart to write, for I had
            no expectation of doing any good. And why should I trouble myself or you to no purpose?
            However, I will once more <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Eccl11:1">cast my bread upon the waters</term>
            </index>,<note place="foot" n="2">Cf. <index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Eccl11:1">Eccl. 11:1</term>
               </index>.</note> and leave the event to God.</p>
         <p>1. You say, &apos;I cannot preach because I have not faith.&apos;<note place="foot"
               n="3">As <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> states later,
               he is quoting from and replying to a letter that <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers1528.xml"/>Okeley</persName> wrote to <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>CW</persName>, which does not appear to have
               survived.</note> That is not the thing; you do not speak simply. The direct reason
            why you did not preach at <placeName>Bristol</placeName> was because you would not
            displease the <seg ana="Moravians">Brethren</seg>. They have still hold of your heart.
            The chain enters into your soul, therefore you could not even seem to <hi rend="italic"
               >act against them</hi>.</p>
         <p>2. &apos;I am not convinced, and cannot be so, that what <hi rend="italic">now
               passes</hi> for faith …&apos; Hold! Do you mean that what <hi rend="italic">now
               passes</hi> for faith among the Methodists is not true Christian faith, that we have
            not a right conception of faith? I know the teachers among <hi rend="italic">the
               Brethren</hi> have not. But the conception which we now have of faith is the same
            which the apostles had, for we conceive <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Heb11:1">faith to be &apos;a divine <foreign rend="italic"
                     >ἔλεγχος</foreign> of things not seen</term>
            </index>&apos;,<note place="foot" n="4"><index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Heb11:1">Heb. 11:1</term>
               </index>; <foreign rend="italic">ἔλεγχος</foreign> is the term translated
               &apos;conviction&apos; in this verse.</note> particularly of this, that Christ loved
               <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and gave himself for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Did St.
            Paul conceive it to be either less or more? <hi rend="italic">You</hi> know he did
            not.</p>
         <p>&apos;But I am not convinced, and cannot be so, that this is experienced by most that
            profess it&apos;—suppose in the united society at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>. I know
            you are not convinced of this and that you cannot be so. But the hindrance lies in your
            heart, not your understanding. You <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> because you <hi
               rend="italic">will not</hi>; so much of the old prejudice still remains, and says,
               <foreign rend="italic">non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris</foreign>.<note
               place="foot" n="5">Aristophanes, <hi rend="italic">Plutus</hi>, l. 60; which
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> translated,
               &apos;Thou shalt not persuade me, though thou dost persuade me&apos; in Sermon 83,
               &apos;On Patience&apos;,  11, 3:177 in this edn.</note> But you <hi rend="italic"
               >ought</hi> to be convinced that <hi rend="italic">most of them</hi> who there
            profess it truly experience what they profess. For (unless they are an whole heap of
            wilful liars, which you <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> not to think without proof) they
            have those fruits which cannot possibly subsist without true Christian faith. They have
               <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Phil4:7">a peace that passes all understanding</term>
            </index><note place="foot" n="6">See <index indexName="biblical">

               indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Rom5:5">the love of God shed abroad in their heart</term>

                  <term cRef="Rom5:5">Rom. 5:5</term>

            all <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Heb12:1">sin, even that which did easily beset them.</term>
            </index><note place="foot" n="8">See <index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Heb12:1">Heb. 12:1</term>
               </index>.</note> Now, what excuse have you for not being convinced that <hi
               rend="italic">they</hi> have faith, who have fruits which nothing but faith can
            produce?</p>
         <p>3. &apos;But they seem at best to have the <hi rend="italic">letter of the new
               covenant</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">spirit of the old</hi>.&apos; How so? What is
            the spirit of the new covenant? Is it not love, the love of God and man? <hi
               rend="italic">This spirit</hi> they have; it is the great moving spring both of their
            desires, designs, words, and actions. This also cannot be denied, unless they are the
            vilest liars upon earth. I speak now more confidently, having last week (together with
            my <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>brother</persName>) examined all one
            by one.</p>
         <p>4. &apos;But still you have not found what you expected among the Methodists, nor can
            you see your way clear to join them.&apos; I think this was the sum of what you wrote to
            my <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2176.xml"/>brother</persName>. But what did you
            expect to have found among them? Faith and love and holiness (whether in your own soul
            or not) you did find among them—at least, you <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to have found
            them, for there they are, which neither men nor devils can deny. What else did you
            expect to find? Or why cannot you see your way clear to join them? I will tell you why.
            You have at least five strong reasons to the contrary: 1) a wife, 2) a mother, 3)
            children, 4) cowardice, 5) love of ease. But are these reasons good in the sight of God?
            I will not affirm that.</p>
         <p>5. &apos;However, <hi rend="italic"><seg ana="Moravians">the Brethren</seg></hi> are
            good men, and I dare not oppose them.&apos; If they are not <hi rend="italic">the only
               people</hi> of God<note place="foot" n="9"><persName><ptr

            if the Scriptures are true), they are not good men; they are very <index

               <term cRef="Num16:26">wicked men</term>
            </index>. They are as a body deceiving and being deceived. They are liars, proud,
            boasters, despisers of those that are good, slaves to an ungodly man, and continually
            labouring to enslave others to him. O take warning at last! <index indexName="biblical">

            destroyed the work of God. Many souls, once full of faith and love, they have caused to
            draw back to perdition. Many they have driven into the deep and then triumphed over
            them. Beware it be not so with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. You have greatly resisted the
            Spirit in this matter! Remember <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2102.xml"/>Richard

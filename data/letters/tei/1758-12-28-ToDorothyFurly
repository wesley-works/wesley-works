            <salute>My Dear Sister,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I thought it long since I heard from you, but I imputed it to your illness. And I did
            not desire you should do anything which would put you to pain or increase your bodily
            weakness.</p>
         <p>When you seemed confident of receiving the promise in a few days, I did not judge it
            needful to say anything to the contrary, both because I was persuaded that expectation
            would be a quickening to your soul, and because I knew you had one near you who was able
            to advise you in any emergency. See that your desires do not cool, and you shall not be
            ashamed of this confident expectation. So long as it is tempered with resignation, it
            can do you no disservice. And what else is there worthy of a desire? Health you shall
            have if health be best, even bodily health. But what is that in comparison of an
            healthful mind? And this you are sure to have.</p>
         <p>I scruple <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>Sarah Ryan</persName>&apos;s
            drinking tar-water because it is so extremely nauseous. Neither will it profit if it
            occasion costiveness,<note place="foot" n="1">Constipation.</note> unless stewed prunes
            be taken every second or third night instead of it. I rather wish she would resume the
            medicine I formerly prescribed, only taking care not to catch cold with it. Perhaps in a
            few days you may see,</p>

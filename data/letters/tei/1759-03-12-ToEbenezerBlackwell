            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>You have entirely satisfied me as to what I was afraid of.<note place="foot" n="1"
               >Referring to tensions with his wife <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2091.xml"
                  />Mary</persName>, see the letter of <date when="1759-03-02">Mar. 2</date>.</note>
            We are at present upon pretty good terms. And I am not without hope that this good
            understanding will continue for some time longer. I am sure it will, if he who has the
            hearts of all men in his hand sees it to be expedient for me.</p>
         <p>You have never yet spoken to me with more freedom than was agreeable to me. Your freedom
            is the best proof of your friendship. There are not many that will deal freely with me.
            Nor indeed are there many from whom I would desire it, lest it should hurt themselves
            without profiting me. But I do desire it of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; and do not doubt
            but it will profit me, as it has done in time past.</p>
         <p>I know not if in all my life I have had so critical a work on my hands as that wherein I
            am now engaged. I am endeavouring to gather up those who were once gathered together and
            afterwards scattered by <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2211.xml"/>James
               Wheatley</persName>.<note place="foot" n="2"><persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2211.xml"/>Wheatley</persName> had been expelled from
               Methodist <seg ana="itinerancy">itinerancy</seg> in <date when="1751">1751</date> for
               sexual immorality (see 26:464–65 in this edn.). He became an independent preacher,
               and built a chapel in <placeName>Norwich</placeName> called the Tabernacle, which
               grew for a while, until further indiscretions by <persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2211.xml"/>Wheatley</persName> came to light. In the
               aftermath, in <date when="1758-11">Nov. 1758</date>
               <persName>Wheatley</persName> offered to lease the Tabernacle to <persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> (see <hi rend="italic"
                  >Journal</hi>, <date when="1758-11-03">Nov. 3, 1758</date>, 21:170 in this edn.),
               who was exploring how he could minister to this bruised and scattered society.</note>
            I have reunited about seventy of them, and hope this evening to make up an hundred. But
            many of them have wonderful spirits, having been always accustomed to teach their
            teachers. So that how they will bear any kind of discipline I cannot well tell.</p>
         <p>At <placeName>Colchester</placeName> the case is far otherwise. About an hundred and
            sixty simple, upright people are there united together, who are as little children,
            minding nothing but the salvation of their souls. Only they are greatly distressed for a
            larger house. What we could have done last Sunday I know not, but that, the day being
            mild, I took the field and preached on <placeName>St. John&apos;s Green</placeName>. I
            see but one way—to build a commodious house; and I desired them to look out for a piece
            of ground. It is true they are poor enough. But if it be God&apos;s work, he will
            provide the means.</p>

         <p>How did you feel yourself under your late trial? Did you find no stirring of resentment,
            no remains of your own will, no desire or wish that things should be otherwise? In one
            sense you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> desire it, because you desire that God should be
            glorified in all things. But did not the falling short of that desire lessen your
            happiness? Had you still the same degree of communion with God, the same joy in the Holy
            Ghost? I never saw you so much moved as you appeared to be that evening. Your soul was
            then greatly troubled, and a variety of conflicting passions — love, sorrow, desire, with
            a kind of despair — were easy to be read in your countenance. And was not your heart
            unhinged at all? Was it not ruffled or discomposed? Was your soul all the time calmly
            stayed on God, waiting upon him without distraction? Perhaps one end of this close trial
            was to give you a deeper knowledge of yourself and of God, of his power to save, and of
            the salvation he hath wrought in you.</p>
         <p>Most of the trials you have lately met with have been of another kind, but it is
            expedient for you to go through both evil and good report. The conversing with you,
            either by speaking or writing, is an unspeakable blessing to me. I cannot think of you
            without thinking of God. Others often lead me to him, but it is, as it were, going round
            about; you bring me straight into his presence.<note place="foot" n="2">The depth of
               spiritual intimacy expressed in this letter stands in contrast with the business-like
               tone <persName>

               intercepted this very letter, and her reading it was a key event leading to the

                        <ptr target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>Mary</persName> and

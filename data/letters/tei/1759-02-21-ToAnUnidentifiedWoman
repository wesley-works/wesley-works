            trouble of the kind which you will receive from me. Therefore you may forgive me this,
            and the rather when you consider my motives to it. You know I can have no temporal view.
            I can have none but a faint, distant hope (because with God all things are possible) of
            doing some service to one whom I love. And this may answer the question which you might
            naturally ask, &apos;What would you have! What do you want with me!&apos; I want you,
            not to be a convert to my opinions, but to be a member of Christ, a child of God, and an
            heir of his kingdom. Be anything as to outward profession, so you are lowly in heart, so
            you resist and conquer every motion of pride, and have that mind in you which was also
            in Christ Jesus. Be what you please besides; only be meek and gentle, and in patience
            possess your soul, so that one may truly say to you,</p>

         <p>Hear what preacher you will, but hear the voice of God, and beware of prejudice and
            every unkind temper. Beware of foolish and hurtful desires or they will pierce you
            through with many sorrows. In one word, be anything but a trifler, a trifler with God
            and your own soul. It was not for this that God gave you</p>

         <p>No, Miss —, no! But that you might employ all your talents to the glory of him that gave
            them. O do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God! Is he not still striving with you!
            Striving to make you not almost but altogether a Christian! Indeed, you must be all or
            nothing— a saint or a devil, eminent in sin or holiness! The good Lord deliver you from
            every snare, and guide your feet in the way of peace! How great a pleasure would this
            give to all your real friends, and in particular to,</p>

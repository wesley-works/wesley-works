            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>Considering the variety of business which must lie upon you, I am not willing to trouble
            you too often, yet cannot any longer delay to return thanks for your favour of <date
               when="1759-05-21">May 21st</date>. How happy is it that there is an higher wisdom
            than our own to guide us through the mazes of life, that we have an unction from the
            Holy One to teach us of all things where human teaching fails! And it certainly must
            fail in a thousand instances. General rules cannot reach all particular cases, in some
            of which there is such a complication of circumstances that <pb n="165"/>God alone can
            show what steps we should take. There is one circumstance in your case which claims your
            peculiar attention, and makes it necessary often to check that boldness and simplicity
            which otherwise would be both your duty and pleasure. But oh how easily may you comply
            too far, and hurt yourself in hopes of gaining another; nay, perhaps hurt the other too,
            by that very compliance which was designed to help! And who is able to lay the line, to
            determine how far you should comply, and where fix your foot! May the God of wisdom
            direct you in all your steps! And I conceive he will rather do this by giving you light
            directly from himself in meditation and private prayer than by the advice of others, who
            can hardly be impartial in so tender a point. Is it not, then, advisable that you should
            much commune with God and your own heart? You may then lay aside all the trappings that
            naturally tend to hide you from yourself, and appear naked, as a poor sinful worm,
            before the great God, the creator of heaven and of earth, the great God, who is your
            father and your friend, who hath prepared for you a kingdom, who calls you to forget the
            little things of earth, and to sit down with him on his throne. O may you dwell on these
            things till they possess your whole soul and cause you to <hi rend="italic">love</hi>
            the honour which cometh of God only!</p>
         <p/>
         <p/>

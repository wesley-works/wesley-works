         <p>It is with great reluctance that I at length begin to write: first, because I abhor
            disputing, and never enter upon it but when I am, as it were, dragged into it by the
            hair of the head; and next, because I have so little hope that any good will arise from
            the present dispute. I fear your passions are too deeply interested in the question to
            admit the force of the strongest reason. So that, were it not for the tender regard I
            have for you, which makes your desire a motive I cannot resist, I should not spend half
            an hour in so thankless a labour, and one wherein I have so little prospect of
            success.</p>
         <!-- There is a noticeable line gap after this para in pdf, do I include? -->
         <p>&apos;The doctrine of perfection&apos;, you say, &apos;has perplexed you much since some
            of our preachers have placed it in so dreadful a light, one of them affirming a
            believer, till perfect, is under the curse of God and in a state of damnation; another,
            if you die before you have attained it, you will surely perish.&apos;</p>
         <p>By &apos;perfection&apos; I mean &apos;perfect love&apos;, or the loving God with all
            our heart, so as to <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="1Thess5:16">rejoice evermore</term>
            </index>, to <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="1Thess5:17">pray without ceasing</term>
            </index>, and <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="1Thess5:18">in everything to give thanks</term>
            </index>.<note place="foot" n="2">See <index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="1Thess5:16-18">1 Thess. 5:16–18</term>
               </index>.</note> I am convinced every believer may attain this, yet I do not say he
            is in a state of damnation or under the curse of God till he does attain. No, he is in a
            state of grace and in favour with God as long as he believes. Neither would I say,
            &apos;If you die without it, you will perish&apos;; but rather, &apos;Till you are saved
            from unholy tempers, you are not ripe for glory. There will, therefore, more promises be
            fulfilled in your soul before God takes you to himself.&apos;</p>
         <p>&apos;But none can attain perfection unless they first believe it attainable.&apos;
            Neither do I affirm this. I know a Calvinist in <placeName>London</placeName> who never
            believed it attainable till the moment she did attain it, and then lay declaring it
            aloud for many days till her spirit returned to God.</p>
         <p>&apos;But you yourself believed twenty years ago that we should not put off the
            infection of nature but with our bodies.&apos; I did so. But I believe otherwise now,
            for many reasons, some of which you afterwards mention. How far Mr. <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers1778.xml"/>[James] Rouquet</persName> or Mr. <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers2127.xml"/>[Thomas] Walsh</persName> may have mistaken these
            I know not. I can only answer for myself.</p>
         <p>&apos;The nature and fitness of things&apos; is so ambiguous an expression that I never
            make use of it. Yet if you ask me, &apos;Is it fit or necessary in the nature of things
            that a soul should be saved from all sin before it enters into glory?&apos; I answer, it
            is. And so it is written, &apos;<index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Rev21:27">No unclean thing shall enter into it</term>
            </index>.&apos;<note place="foot" n="3"><index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Rev21:27">Rev. 21:27</term>
               </index>.</note> Therefore, whatever degrees of holiness they did or did not attain
            in the preceding parts of life, neither Jews nor heathens any more than Christians ever
            did or ever will enter into the New Jerusalem
            <!-- Would this (New Jerusalem) get a placename tag? -->
            unless they are cleansed from all sin before they enter into eternity.</p>
         <p>I do by no means exclude the Old Testament from bearing witness to any truths of God.
            Nothing less! But I say the experience of the <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi> is not the
            standard of <hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> experience and that therefore, were it true
            &apos;The Jews did not love God with all their heart and soul&apos;, it would not follow
            &apos;Therefore no Christian can&apos;, because we may attain what they did not.</p>
         <p>&apos;But&apos;, you say, &apos;either their words do not contain a promise of <hi
               rend="italic">such perfection</hi>, or God did not fulfil this promise to them to
            whom he made it.&apos; I answer, he surely will fulfil it to <hi rend="italic">them to
               whom he made it</hi>—namely, to the Jews <hi rend="italic">after their dispersion
               into all lands</hi>. And to these is the promise made, as will be clear to any who
            impartially considers the 30th chapter of Deuteronomy, wherein it stands.</p>
         <p>I doubt whether this perfection can be proved by <index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Luke6:40">Luke 6:40</term>
            </index>. From <index indexName="biblical">

            </index> (which belongs to all the children of God) I never attempted to prove it. But I
            still think it is clearly described in those words, &apos;<index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="1John4:17">As he is, so are we in this world</term>
            </index>.&apos;<note place="foot" n="4"><index indexName="biblical">

            a glass, but face to face, and be transformed into his likeness.</p>
         <p>Those expressions (<index indexName="biblical">

            </index>), &apos;<index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="John13:10">Ye are clean, clean every whit</term>
            </index>,&apos; are allowed to refer to justification only. But that expression,

                  <term cRef="1John1:7">1 John 1:7</term>
               </index>.</note> cannot refer to justification only. It does not relate to
            justification at all, whatever the other clause may do. Therefore those texts are by no
            means parallel, neither can the latter be limited by the former, although it is sure the
            privileges described in both belong to every adult believer.</p>

               <term cRef="James3:2">we all</term>
            </index>&quot; was never before understood to exclude the person speaking.&apos;<note
               place="foot" n="12"><persName><ptr target="/persons/pers0934.xml"/>Hardy</persName>
               is specifically rejecting <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />Wesley</persName>&apos;s treatment of this verse in Sermon 40, <hi rend="italic"
                  >Christian Perfection</hi>, II.17 (2:114–15 in this edn.).</note> Indeed it was.
            It is unquestionably to be understood so as to exclude Isaiah, the person speaking,
               &apos;<index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Isaiah64:6">We are all as an unclean thing. We all do fade as a leaf; and
                  our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away</term>

            </index>)<!-- I only found this under Isaiah 64:6, not 44:6 for King James Version -->.
            For this was not the case with Isaiah himself. Of himself he says, &apos;<index
               indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Isaiah61:10">My soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me
                  with the garments of salvation. He hath covered me with the robe of
                  righteousness</term>
            </index>&apos; (<index indexName="Isaiah61:10">

            </index>)<!-- Same with this, I only found under Isaiah 61:10, not 41:10 King James Version-->.
            Here the prophet, like the apostle, uses the word &apos;we&apos; instead of
            &apos;you&apos; to soften the harshness of an unpleasing truth.</p>
         <p>In this chapter the apostle is not cautioning them against censuring others, but
            entering upon a new argument wherein the second verse has an immediate reference to the
            first, but none at all to the thirteenth of the preceding chapter.<note place="foot"
               n="13"><index indexName="biblical">

         <p>I added, &quot; &apos;We offend all&quot; cannot be spoken of all […] Christians, for
            immediately there follows the mention of one who &quot;offends not,&quot; as the

            perfect will of God, which those, and those only, are able to do who love God with all
            their hearts. And yet these very persons can sincerely say, &apos;Forgive us our
            trespasses.&apos; For as long as they are in the body, they are liable to mistake and to
            speak or act according to that mistaken judgement.<note place="foot" n="16">Another
               instance of <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>&apos;s

               &apos;a voluntary transgression of a known law of God&apos;; cf. <persName><ptr

            Therefore they cannot abide the rigour of justice, but still need mercy and
            forgiveness.</p>
         <p>Were <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to ask, &apos;What if I should die this moment?&apos; I
            should answer, I believe you would be saved, because I am persuaded none that has faith
            can die before he is made ripe for glory. This is the doctrine which I continually teach
            which has nothing to do with justification by works. Nor can it discourage any who have
            faith, neither weaken their peace, nor damp their joy in the Lord. True believers are
            not distressed hereby, either in life or in death; unless in some rare instance wherein
            the temptation of the devil is joined with a melancholy temper.</p>
         <p>Upon the whole, I observe your great argument turns all along on a mistake of the
            doctrine. Whatever warm expressions may drop from young men, we do not teach that any
            believer is under condemnation. So that all the inferences drawn from this supposition
            fall to the ground at once.</p>
         <p>Your other letter I hope to consider hereafter. Though I have great reason to apprehend
            your prejudice will still be too strong for my arguments. However, whether you expect it
            or not, I must wish for your perfection. You of all people have most need of perfect
            love, because this alone casts out fear.</p>

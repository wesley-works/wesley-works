            <salute>Dear Sammy,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>You have done well in writing to me the first week of this month. I should be glad if
            you would continue that regularly. And you have done exceeding well in giving me the
            full, particular account of that (shall I say unlucky?) accident. For really <foreign
               rend="italic">non satis mihi constiterat, cum aliquane animi mei molestia an potirer
               libenter […] accepi</foreign>.<note place="foot" n="2">Cf. Cicero, Epistolae,
               xiii.1.1–2 (Letters, 63.1–2): &apos;I was not quite sure whether to accept it with
               distress or pleasure&apos; (Loeb).</note> I am grieved. I am troubled for the
            consequences that may ensue. But I am pleased. I rejoice that the Lord has carried on
            such a work of conviction in that poor Pharisee. Yea, I cannot but be exceeding glad
               <foreign rend="italic">me non laborem inanem cepisse</foreign>.<note place="foot"
               n="3">Cf. Terence, Hecyra (&apos;The Mother-in-Law&apos;), Act 3, Scene 2 (l. 344),
               &apos;[That I not] labour in a useless task&apos; (Loeb).</note></p>
         <p>Neither am I sorry but rather well satisfied that you lent her that little
            &apos;awakening tract&apos;. Upon the first hearing of this, indeed, my spirit was
            troubled. Confusion of mind seized me, struck partly with fear, partly with sorrow, and
            partly with astonishment. But what need we fear? Or wherefore are we cast down? <index
               indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Rev19:6">The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth</term>
            </index>.<note place="foot" n="4">See <index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Rev19:6">Rev. 19:6</term>
               </index>.</note> And cannot he make all things turn to his glory? How long shall the
            boasting enemy triumph? Not longer (at least) than the breath is in his nostrils; and
            then shall all his vain thoughts perish. But they have not yet won the day. Who knoweth
            but the Lord may give peace and love and power and the spirit of a sound mind to her who
            for a season is sorely vexed with the cruel overwhelming power of Satan? At a moment
            when the ungodly think not of it, the Lord may arise and maintain his own cause and put
            to silence the vauntings of the proud. So that all that are around may see it and fear,
            and acknowledge, &apos;<index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="Mark12:11">This is the Lord’s doing</term>
            </index>&apos;.<note place="foot" n="5"><index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="Mark12:11">Mark 12:11</term>

         <p>What he does now we know not yet. It is our part to wait patiently to see what he will
            do. <foreign rend="italic">Quietus esto</foreign>.<note place="foot" n="6">&apos;Be at
               rest.&apos;</note> Be calm in the midst of this storm. I pity you, indeed, who are in
            the very midst of it. For my own part I leave the matter without concern in his hands
            who will not, cannot do wrong. But not without taking much shame unto myself. I did not
            order my conversation aright all the time I was in the place. I was afraid of giving
            offence, therefore I assumed too much the appearance of one of them. I did not dare to
            be altogether singular, to be constantly, steadily serious before them. Now by this
            circumstance the Lord has rebuked me and taught me wisdom. Here he has permitted no
            small offence to arise from a quarter I could neither foresee nor prevent. Where now is
            all my worldly prudence? What is become of my fearful caution? The Lord hath blasted it.
            Not indeed with the breath of his mouth, but with the rushing torrent of his sudden
            providence. Mark this, and settle it in thine heart that the Lord will be feared,
            honoured, and obeyed even in the midst of lions; or will make us feel the weight of his
            uplifted hand. I feel this moment my just punishment for my base cowardice. This sin
            sets heavier upon my conscience at this time than almost all my crimes and all the
            transgressions of my youth. And one sin lying upon the conscience is a load of
               misery.<note place="foot" n="7">The preceding three paragraphs are a single paragraph
               in the original.</note></p>
         <p>There is not now time to give you any particular relation of myself, that affair having
            spun out my letter too long. In study at present I make but a slow progress. I am not at
            all content with myself in this point. I have just entered upon Lord Clarendon’s <hi
               rend="italic">History</hi>,<note place="foot" n="8">Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon,
                  <hi rend="italic">The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England</hi>, 6
               vols. (2nd edn.; Oxford, <date from="1705" to="1706">1705–6</date>).</note> which is
            such an account of the ways, vices, and passions of men as one who did not know the
            corruption of human nature could scarce be induced to believe of his fellow
            creatures.</p>
         <p>I shall conclude this letter with affirming that I would to God such a deep work of
            conviction was wrought in your heart and mine as God has begun in that poor distressed
            woman. I wish we also felt the arrows of the Lord fastened in our conscience even as she
            has done. O when shall we with that piercing sense repent of all our sins and all our
            backslidings? Is not the time now come? We are spared today. God knoweth whether we
            shall be tomorrow. But this we know, that whatever knowledge, whatever gifts we have,
            purity of heart alone will be of true worth in the end. To the earnest pursuit of which
            I commend your being,</p>
         <closer><signed>Yours, etc.,<lb/><persName>John Wesley</persName></signed></closer>

            <salute>My Dear Molly,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I must write once more. Then, if I hear nothing from you, I have done.</p>
         <p>Above a year ago, while I suspected nothing less, you opened my bureau and took out many
            of my letters and papers. Mr. <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0179.xml"
               />Blackwell</persName> advised me, before you, if you refused to restore them, to
            send that instant for a smith and break open your bureau and take my own, to prevent
            which you restored them. But it was not long before you robbed me again, and showed my
            private letters to more than twenty different persons on purpose to make them have an
            ill opinion of me. For the same end you spoke much evil of me while I was several
            hundred miles off.<note place="foot" n="1"><persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />JW</persName> defines &apos;evil-speaking&apos; as &apos;speaking evil of an
               absent person&apos; in Sermon 49, &apos;The Cure of Evil-speaking&apos;
               <!-- Should there be a tag to link to this sermon? -->, §1, 2:252 in this
            edn.</note></p>
         <pb n="160"/>
         <p>Your pretence was that I conversed with sisters <persName><ref
                  target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>Ryan</persName> and <persName><ref
                  target="/persons/pers0506.xml"/>Crosby</persName>.<note place="foot" n="2">I.e,
               his correspondence with <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>Sarah
                  Ryan</persName> and <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0506.xml"/>Sarah
                  Crosby</persName></note> I know it was only a pretence, and told your friends the
            humouring you herein would leave matters just where they were. I knew giving a person
            drink would not cure a dropsy.<note place="foot" n="3">&apos;Dropsy&apos; was the term
               for swelling of bodily tissue due to accumulating liquid (i.e., an edema); thus,
                     <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> is saying that you
               do not cure a problem by giving in to it.</note> However, at their instance I made
            the experiment. I broke off all correspondence with them, whether by speaking or
               writing.<note place="foot" n="4">Indeed, there is no evidence of correspondence
               between <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> and
                     <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0506.xml"/>Crosby</persName> or
                     <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>Ryan</persName> after <date
                  when="1758-12">Dec. 1758</date>, until the mid <date>1760s</date>.</note> For a
            while, having gained your point, you was in a good humour. Afterwards it was just as I
            said. You robbed me again. And your sin (as before) carried its own punishment, for the
            papers you had stole harrowed up your soul and tore your poor fretful spirit in
            pieces.</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding this, you wrote me two loving letters.<note place="foot" n="5">These
               letters have not survived, because <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2091.xml"
                  />Mary</persName> requested <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />JW</persName> to destroy her letters after he received them.</note> (I hope, not
            with a design of reading them to other people; which I shall not suspect if you assure
            me you have not read or shown them in part or in whole to any one.) So that I was a
            little surprised when at our meeting in <placeName>Colchester</placeName> I found you
            thoroughly out of humour.<note place="foot" n="6"><persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName> was in
                  <placeName>Colchester</placeName> on <date when="1759-03-19">Mar. 19, 1759</date>,
               though his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> makes no mention of <persName><ref
                     target="/persons/pers2091.xml"/>Mary</persName>&apos;s presence there; see
               21:179 in this edn.</note> It really seemed as if you was heartily vexed by the
            papers you had taken, and so were resolved to have it out with me. Accordingly you could
            not refrain from throwing squibs<note place="foot" n="7">&apos;Squibs&apos;: broken
               firecrackers, a term used to describe caustic conversational insults.</note> at me
            even in company, and from speaking with such keenness when we were alone as I think no
            wife ought to speak to an husband— such as I apprehend you could not have used decently
            to any but <persName><ref target="/persons/pers2092.xml"/>Noah Vazeille</persName>.<note
               place="foot" n="8"><persName><ref target="/persons/pers2091.xml"
               />Mary</persName>&apos;s son by her first husband, who would be 12 years old at the
               time.</note></p>
         <p>Perhaps you may now take the greater liberty, because, having stripped me of all my
            papers, you imagine it is now absolutely impossible for me to justify myself. But you
            are under a mistake. To all that know me, my word is a sufficient justification. And if
            anything more is needful, I know One that is able to say to the grave, &apos;Give
            back!&apos; Yea, and if he say it to jealousy, cruel as the grave, it shall hear and
            obey his voice.</p>
         <pb n="161"/>
         <p>Wishing you the blessing which you now want above any other, namely, unfeigned and deep
            repentance, I remain,</p>
         <closer><signed>Your much injured yet still affectionate husband,<lb/><persName>John
                  Wesley</persName></signed></closer>

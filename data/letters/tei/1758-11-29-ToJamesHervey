            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>A week or two ago, in my return from <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, I met with
                  <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers1620.xml"/>Mr. Pierce of Bury</persName>, who
            informed me of a conversation which he had had a few days before. Mr. <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers0512.xml"/>Cudworth</persName>, he said, then told him
            &apos;that he had prevailed on <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers0995.xml"/>Mr.
               Hervey</persName> to write against me,<note place="foot" n="2"><persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers0995.xml"/>James Hervey</persName> was drafting a set of
               letters in reply to <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName>.
               But his health was declining fast (he died on <date when="1758-12-25">Dec.
               25</date>), and perhaps persuaded by this letter, he decided not to make them public
               (entrusting them to the care of his brother <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers0996.xml"/>William</persName>). The letters were known,
               however, among some of <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers0995.xml"
                  />Hervey</persName>&apos;s associates and in <date when="1764">1764</date> one of
               these associates published them surreptitiously. Thus in <date when="1764-11">Nov.
                  1764</date>
               <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>Wesley</persName> wrote one more
               (posthumous) response to <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers0995.xml"
                  />Hervey</persName>; see 13:377–90 in this edn.</note> who likewise, in what he
            had written, referred to the book which he (Mr. <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers0512.xml"/>Cudworth</persName>) had lately
               published&apos;.<note place="foot" n="3"><persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers0512.xml"/>William Cudworth</persName>, a staunch
               Calvinist, had recently published <hi rend="italic">A Preservative in Perilous
                  Times</hi> (<placeName>London</placeName>, <date when="1758">1758</date>), which
               included extended critiques of two publications by <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers2180.xml"/>JW</persName>.</note></p>
         <p>Every one is welcome to write what he pleases concerning me. But would it not be well
            for you to remember that before I published anything concerning you I sent it to you in
            a private letter; that I waited for an answer for several months, but was not favoured
            with one line; that when at length I published part of what I had sent you, I did it in
            the most inoffensive manner possible—in the latter end of a larger work, purely designed
            to preserve those in connexion with me from being tossed to and fro by various
               doctrines?<note place="foot" n="4"><persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />Wesley</persName>&apos;s letter was sent privately to <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers0995.xml"/>Hervey</persName> in <date when="1756-10">Oct.
                  1756</date>, and not published until <date when="1758-06">June 1758</date> in <hi
                  rend="italic">A Preservative against Unsettled Notions in Religion</hi>; see
               13:323–44 in this edn.</note> What, therefore, I may fairly expect from my friend is
            to mete to me with the same measure, to send to me first in a private manner any
            complaint he has against me, to wait as many months as I did, and if I give you none or
            no satisfactory answer, then to lay the matter before the world, if you judge it will be
            to the glory of God.</p>
         <p>But, whatever you do in this respect, one thing I request of you. Give no countenance to
            that insolent, scurrilous, virulent libel which bears the name of <persName><ptr
                  target="/persons/pers0512.xml"/>William Cudworth</persName>. Indeed, how you can
            converse with a man of his spirit I cannot comprehend. O leave not your old, well-tried
            friends! The new is not comparable to them. I speak not this because I am afraid of what
            any one can say or do to me. But I am really concerned for you. An evil man has gained
            the ascendant over you, and has persuaded a dying man, who had shunned it all his life,
            to enter into controversy as he is stepping into eternity! Put off your armour, my
            brother! You and I have no moments to spare. Let us employ them all in promoting peace
            and goodwill among men. <index indexName="biblical">

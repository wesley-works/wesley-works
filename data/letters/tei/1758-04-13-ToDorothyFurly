         <p>But if you find such a surprising alteration at Bonner&apos;s Hall,<note place="foot"
               n="1">Bonner&apos;s Hall, in the parish of <placeName>Hackney</placeName> in
                  <placeName>Middlesex</placeName>, was a manor house that had been a palace of the
               Bishops of <placeName>London</placeName>.</note> what need have you of removing to
               <placeName>Bristol</placeName>? Perhaps a lodging there might answer the purpose of
            health full as well as one at <placeName>Clifton</placeName>, and the purpose of
            religion considerably better.<note place="foot" n="2"><placeName>Clifton</placeName> was
               adjacent to Hot Wells, a mineral springs many visited to seek its health benefits. It
               was also the location of one of <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers0964.xml"/>Lady
                  Huntingdon</persName>&apos;s homes; <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers2180.xml"
                  />JW</persName> may be trying to protect <persName><ptr
                     target="/persons/pers0762.xml"/>Furly</persName> from Calvinist influences that
                     <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers0762.xml"/>she</persName> would meet with
               there.</note> There are few in that neighbourhood from whom I should hope you would
            receive much profit, except <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>Sarah
               Ryan</persName>. If <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>she</persName>
            abides in her integrity, <persName><ptr target="/persons/pers1793.xml"/>she</persName>
            is a jewel indeed; one whose equal I have not yet found in England.</p>
         <p>You ought not to drink much tea, and none without pretty much cream (not milk) and
            sugar. But I believe, were you to drink nettletea for a few mornings, it would do you
            more good than any other. It seems best for you to have frequent returns of weakness. It
            may be needful to fix seriousness upon your spirit by a lasting impression that there is
            but a step between you and eternity. But sickness alone will not do this—no, nor even
            the near approach of death. Unless the Spirit of God sanctify both, a man may laugh and
            trifle with his last breath.</p>
         <p>You will overcome trifling conversation and the fear of man not by yielding, but by
            fighting. This is a cross which you cannot be excused from taking up. Bear it, and it
            will bear you. By prayer you will receive power so to do, to be a good soldier of Jesus
            Christ. But it is more difficult to resist hurtful desire; I am most afraid you should
            give way to this. Herein you have need of all the power of God. O stand fast! Look up
            and receive strength! I shall be glad to hear that you are <index indexName="biblical">

            with your spirit.</p>

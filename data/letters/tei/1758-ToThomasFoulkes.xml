         <p>The glory of the Wesleyan Methodists is not to dispute with anybody concerning their
            opinion. We know that the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink, nor opinions of any
            sort. What we need is that mind which was in Christ, to teach us to walk as Christ
            walked. But one cannot lay hold on this except by a life of constant and complete
            self-denial. There is a great danger of your being inconstant in this, unless you have
            vigilant Christians about you. In <placeName>Chester</placeName> you would certainly
            enjoy such; how it is at <placeName>Bala</placeName> I know not.</p>
         <p>The best books I know for one in your situation are <hi rend="italic">Serious Call</hi>
            and <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi> by <persName>
                    <ptr target="/persons/pers1261.xml"/>Mr. Law</persName>; I mean the abbreviated edition
            of them which I published years ago. I am grateful to you for the note you sent in your
            letter. David <!-- Which david is this --> is poor enough, but he is increasing in
            grace. Let us safeguard that matter, and all will be well. I am,</p>

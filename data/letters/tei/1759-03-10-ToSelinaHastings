         <p>The agreeable hour which I spent with your Ladyship the last week recalled to my mind
            the former times, and gave me much matter of thankfulness to the giver of every good
            gift. I have found great satisfaction in conversing with those instruments whom God has
            lately raised up. But still there is I know not what in them whom we have known from the
            beginning, and who have borne the burden and heat of the day, which we do not find in
            those who have risen up since, though they are upright of heart. Perhaps, too, those who
            have but lately come into the harvest are led to think and speak<pb n="155"/> more
            largely of justification and the other first principles of the doctrine of Christ. And
            it may be proper for <hi rend="italic">them</hi> so to do. Yet <hi rend="italic">we</hi>
            find a thirst after something farther. We want to sink deeper and rise higher in the
            knowledge of God our Saviour. We want all helps for walking closely with him whom we
            have received, that we may the more speedily come to <index indexName="biblical">

            all whom it has pleased God to employ in reviving primitive Christianity. I designed to
            have spent but one night with him, but Mr. <persName><ref target="/persons/pers0806.xml"

            now twelve or fourteen miles to hear him, and very few come in vain. His word is with
            power. He speaks as plain and home as <persName><ref target="/persons/pers1496.xml"

            by the walls of an old castle, and behaved as men who felt that God was there.</p>

                  <persName>Johnson</persName>&apos;.</note> surprised me last night by informing me
            you are left mistress of a large fortune. Shall I say, agreeably surprised me! I cannot
            tell. Because I believe there is another world, and I do not know what influence this
            change may have on your condition. Therefore I am in fear and in hope. You may be hereby
            far more happy or far more miserable in eternity! O make a stand! Consider the situation
            you are in. Perhaps never before were you in so great danger. You know a little of your
            natural tempers. Now you have means of indulging and thereby inflaming them to the
            uttermost. And how many will incite you so to do! How few will dare to warn you against
            it! Now what food will you have for <hi rend="italic">pride</hi>! What infinite
            temptations to think more highly than you ought to think! You do so already. But O where
            will you stop! The good Lord arrest the storm in mid career! How impetuously now, unless
            God interpose, must <hi rend="italic">self-will</hi> whirl you along! How deeply, unless
            he help, will you shortly be immersed in practical atheism, as ten thousand things will
            concur to drive God out of your thoughts, as much as if he were not in the world! But,
            above all, how will you escape from being swallowed up in <hi rend="italic"
               >idolatry</hi>, love of the world, such as you never knew before!</p>
         <pb n="158"/>
         <p>Hitherto you have been greatly superior to every delicacy in <hi rend="italic"
            >food</hi>. But even this may assault you now, and perhaps raise in you other <hi
               rend="italic">desires</hi> which you are now a stranger to. At present you are above
            the follies of <hi rend="italic">dress</hi>; but will you be so a twelvemonth hence? May
            you not easily slide into the &apos;<index indexName="biblical">
               <term cRef="1john2:16">pride of life</term>
            </index>&apos;,<note place="foot" n="2"><index indexName="biblical">
                  <term cRef="1john2:16">1 John 2:16</term>
               </index>.</note> in this as well as other instances, especially considering how your
               <hi rend="italic">vanity</hi> will be gratified thereby! For who will not <hi
               rend="italic">admire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">applaud</hi> your admirable taste! It
            will only remain for you to <hi rend="italic">marry</hi> some agreeable person that has
            much wit and sense with little or no religion; then it is finished! Either you will be
            thoroughly miserable in this world or miserable to eternity.</p>
         <p>&apos;But what business is this of yours! Cannot you let me alone! What have I to do
            with you!&apos; Believe me, I could very easily let you alone, if I had not a real and
            tender goodwill toward you, and if I did not know (what perhaps you do not) that you
            have need even of me. You want friends who understand you well, and who dare tell you
            the whole, plain truth; and yet not in a surly, imperious manner, for then you could not
            receive it. I have endeavoured to do this once more. Will not you forgive me! I cannot
            but think, if you do not thank, you will at least excuse,</p>

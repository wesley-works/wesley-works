            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>Since I received your favour I have had many thoughts on worldly and Christian prudence.
            What is the nature of each? How do they differ? How may we distinguish one from the
            other?</p>
         <p>It seems <hi rend="italic">worldly prudence</hi> either pursues <hi rend="italic"
               >worldly ends</hi>—riches, honour, ease, or pleasure—or pursues Christian ends on <hi
               rend="italic">worldly maxims</hi> or by <hi rend="italic">worldly means</hi>. The
            grand maxims which obtain in the world are: The more power, the more money, the more
            learning, and the more reputation a man has, the more good he will do. And whenever a
            Christian, pursuing the noblest ends, forms his behaviour by these maxims, he will
            infallibly (though perhaps by insensible degrees) decline into worldly prudence. He will
            use more or less of conformity to the world, if not in sin, yet in doing some things
            that are good in themselves yet (all things considered) are not good to him, and perhaps
            at length using guile or disguise, simulation or dissimulation, either seeming to be
            what he is not, or not seeming to be what he is. By any of these marks may worldly
            prudence be discerned from the wisdom which is from above.</p>
         <pb n="162"/>
         <p>This, <hi rend="italic">Christian prudence</hi>, pursues <hi rend="italic">Christian
               maxims</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">Christian means</hi>. The ends it pursues are
            holiness in every kind and in the highest degree, and usefulness in every kind and
            degree. And herein it proceeds on the following maxims: The help that is done upon
            earth, God doeth it himself. <index indexName="biblical">
